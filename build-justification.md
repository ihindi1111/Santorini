Determining a Valid Build
Responsibilities:

Board Object: Knows the state of each tile, including level, presence of a dome
Tile Object: Can determine if a tower can be built on (spot is open, not already at max level)
Worker Object: Build the building if valid

Methods:
Tile.isBuildable(): Validates if a build action is possible at a given position and whether a dome can be built.
Worker.build(): If validated, builds upon the tile from the worker

Justification:
Information Expert Principle: The Tile object holds the information about its state, so it should be responsible for determining if a build action is valid
Low Coupling: By delegating the responsibility of validation to the Tile object, we reduce the dependency of the Board on the inner workings of a Tile and allows worker to be responsible for building

Performing the Build
Responsibilities:

Board Object: Should delegate the build action to the appropriate Tile.
Tile Object: Should update its state to reflect the build action.
Worker Object: Should perform the build action if next to the identified square

Methods:
Tile.isBuildable(): Updates the Tile's state to reflect the build action.
Worker.build(): Builds upon the tile if available

Justification:
Encapsulation: The Tile's state is encapsulated, and its modification is done through its own methods, preserving the integrity of the object but uses Worker to ensure that the correct Worker is nearby.

Alternatives Considered

Centralized Building Logic in Game:
Trade-off: Would have reduced the complexity of the Tile class but increased the Game's responsibilities, making it more prone to change for different reasons and violating SRP

Final Design Decision
The chosen design has the Board object act as a coordinator that delegates build actions to the individual Tile objects. Each Tile is then responsible for knowing and updating its state along with Worker to validate it is the right Worker. This approach respects the principles of object-oriented design.

Object-Level Interaction Diagram
In the object-level interaction diagram, you would see the following method calls:

Player or Game calls Tile.isBuildable()

Assuming the build is valid:
Player called Worker.build()
Game calls Worker.build() on the specific Tile object
Tile updates its state (increments level or sets hasDome to true)

This design maintains a clear separation of concerns, with each class handling its own specific part of the build action. The Board manages the overall game state and delegates specific actions to the Tiles, which are the experts on their own state but then make sure to have the correct Worker nearby to ensure a proper addition. This keeps the system flexible and the individual classes focused and cohesive.
